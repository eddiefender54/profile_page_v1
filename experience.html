        <p>I currently own and operate a highly profitable IT Consulting company but am looking to pursue a career as a Web Developer.  
          Each business I have endeavored, whether Golf, IT, or retail management, I have flourished. 
          I have a deep passion for web design as I have always considered myself an artistic professional.  
          Being a prosperous businessman running a $500,000 small business with 35% in net profits, I feel can bring that knowledge and passion for success into any company 
          with my skills.
